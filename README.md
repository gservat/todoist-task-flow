# Todoist Task Flow for Home Assistant

An advanced, yet easy-to-use card for Home Assistant that displays your Todoist tasks. It is designed to look and feel like a "native" app directly in your dashboard.

## 🚀 Why this card? (The New Architecture)

This card is built specifically for Home Assistant's modern **`todoist` integration**.

Many older Todoist cards rely on:

* **Deprecated methods:** Reading task lists from sensor attributes (which bloats your database).

* **Calendar integration:** Which isn't designed for task management.

* **Iframes:** Embedding the entire Todoist website, which is heavy and slow on mobile.

**Todoist Task Flow** communicates directly with the official integration via efficient WebSocket calls. This means:

* **⚡️ Fast & Lightweight:** No attributes cluttering your state machine.

* **🔒 Secure:** Uses standard Home Assistant services (`todo.add_item`, `todo.update_item`).

* **🔮 Future-proof (hopefully):** Aligned with Home Assistant's long-term architecture for task lists.

## ✨ Features

* **🎨 Multiple Themes:** Choose between *Standard*, *Minimalist*, *Frosted Glass*, and *Bubble Card* designs.

* **🛠️ Customization:** Hide header, hide "add task", change colors, adjust font size, and much more directly in the visual editor.

* **🎮 Gamification:** Make chores fun with optional sound effects and confetti animations upon completion.

* **📅 Smart Dates:** Displays dates naturally like "Today", "Tomorrow", or "On Monday" instead of raw dates.

* **⚡️ Live Updates:** The card updates automatically and remembers your scroll position.

* **📱 Mobile Friendly:** Special "Compact View" and collapsible sections for small screens.

* **🗒️ Project tags:** Allows for multiple lists in the same overview, without needing vertical stacks.

## ♥️ Credit
Credits to my wife for pushing me to come up with a solution for our HA dashboard, that shows our todoist tasks correctly, and for helping me with features.
The card is made with a huge focus on WAF (Wife Acceptance Focus) and my ADHD brain (Possibility for gamification, limited tasks etc.)
